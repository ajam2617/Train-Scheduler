# Train-Scheduler
Train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. App will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
Deployed site: https://ajam2617.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

# Getting Started
Enter a train name, destination, first train time, and frequency of the train in minutes. Example:
Money Train
Las Vegas, NV
21:30
21
When the submit button is selected, the information will populate, and show the a count down to the next arrival. 

#Issues
I could not quite get the countdown to the next train to work. I'm definitely had issues with the format shown and the interval update. I did have all the theory correct, but I did not have my work organized in a way that was functional. I definitely feel more comfortable with the modulos and moment.js methods. The app is now working correctly!
